/*
  Warnings:

  - The `emailVerified` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `emailVerifiedDate` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `name` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `password` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `verificationCode` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `verificationCodeExpires` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
